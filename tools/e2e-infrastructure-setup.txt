these notes are just a reminder, it may be necessary to adjust the instructions
to a different webdriver grid configuration. These are commands of how to setup
the grid being used at the time of this writing: a linux hub, a linux node with
Chrome and FF (both x64) and a windows x32 node with Opera

on linux run java -jar SELENIUM.JAR -role hub
on linux run java -Dwebdriver.gecko.driver=GECKODRIVER \
  -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=CHROMEDRIVER -jar SELENIUM.JAR -role node \
  -nodeConfig NODE-CONFIG.JSON
on windows run java -jar SELENIUM.JAR -role node -nodeConfig \
  NODE-CONFIG-WIN.JSON
it may be necessary to install VC_redist.x86.exe to run a node with opera on
  windows
on windows it's convenient to create a shortcut to the Command Prompt and set
  the option to start in your test directory, and to add
  '/k COMMAND_TO_START_NODE' to be able to start the node with a double-click on
  the shortcut
